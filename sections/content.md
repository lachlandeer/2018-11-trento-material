# Preliminaries

## Introductions

* Instructors:
    * Marianne
    * Lachlan (me)
* Organizers:
    * Rafaello
    * (Others...)
* Helpers:
    - Gianfranco Abrusci, Mirko Bagnarol, Matteo Finazzer, Simone Orioli, Michele Turelli
- Learners:
    * You

## Learning Objectives


* **Goal:** gain familiarity with a 'reproducible' computational workflow
    * How?: *hands-on* workshop
    * Coverage:
        * the Unix Shell: text based instructions
        * Git: Version control
        * Python
        * Reproducible Workflows: Make

## Learning Objectives


*We don't expect you to have any computational experience before we start*

- By the end we want you to be able to:
    1. work with data in Python (summary/group statistics, plotting) ...
    1. ... in a way that is reproducible by yourself and others
- My number one coding tip:
    - Don't focus on the syntax, but on the way we think
        - you can google the syntax, hard to google how we think

## Learning Environment

* I like learning environments that are *relaxed*, but *focussed*
    * Communicate as peers, there's no hierachy in this room

* Feel free to:
    * Interupt and ask questions
    * Share relevant experiences
    * Let us know when something isn't working for you
    * Talk to us in breaks

* Why have we given you sticky notes?
    * Letting us know how you are progressing
    * Providing us with feedback

* There is a code of conduct [here](http://www.datacarpentry.org/code-of-conduct/)
    * Summary: *Let's be nice to each other*
